-- Problem 1
-- Return pair containing roots of quadratic equation a*x**2 + b*x + c.
-- The first element in the returned pair should use the positive 
-- square-root of the discriminant, the second element should use the 
-- negative square-root of the discriminant.  Need not handle complex
-- roots.

-- Problem 2
-- Return infinite list containing [z, f(z), f(f(z)), f(f(f(z))), ...]
-- May use recursion.
iterateFunction :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
iterateFunction f z =
  undefined

-- Problem 3
-- Using iterateFunction return infinite list containing 
-- multiples of n by all the non-negative integers.
-- May NOT use recursion.
multiples n =
  undefined

-- Problem 4
-- Use iterateFunction to return an infinite list containing list 
-- of hailstone numbers starting with n.
-- Specifically, if i is a hailstone number, and i is even, then
-- the next hailstone number is i divided by 2; if i is a hailstone
-- number and i is odd, then the next hailstone number is 3*i + 1.
-- May NOT use recursion.
-- See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture>

-- Problem 5
-- Return length of hailstone sequence starting with n terminating

-- May NOT use recursion.  Can use elemIndex from Data.List

-- Problem 6

-- Problem 7
-- Fold tree to a single value.  If tree is a Tree node, then it's
-- folded value is the result of applying ternary treeFn to the result
-- of folding the left sub-tree, the value stored in the Tree node and
-- the result of folding the right sub-tree; if it is a Leaf node,
-- then the result of the fold is the result of applying the unary
-- leafFn to the value stored within the Leaf node.
-- May use recursion.

-- Problem 8
-- Return list containing flattening of tree.  The elements of the

-- an in-order traversal of the tree. Must be implemented using foldTree.
